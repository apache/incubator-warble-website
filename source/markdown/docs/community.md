### How to get involved

The main development and design discussion happens on our mailing lists.
We have a list specifically for development, and one for future user questions and feedback.

To join in the discussion on the design and roadmap, you can send an email to [dev@warble.apache.org](mailto:dev@warble.apache.org).<br/>
You can subscribe to the list by sending an email to [dev-subscribe@warble.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@warble.apache.org).<br/>
You can also browse the archives online at [lists.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@warble.apache.org).

We also have an IRC channel, #warble on [Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#warble)<br/>
You can also access our HipChat channel at: [https://www.hipchat.com/gTFBvgmMG](https://www.hipchat.com/gTFBvgmMG)

HipChat and IRC are bridged, so whichever channel you speak in, we'll see it :)
